1) The spec appears to be wrong when considering the expected results from the spec. I have therefore removed 5, 2, & 1p from the currency denominations.
2) In researching for this project, I read the following online resources:
	a) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coin-change-dp-7/
	b) https://algorithmist.com/wiki/Coin_change
3) Given 2 above, you'll therefore see unit tests and CoinMachineAnalysis files (pdf or visio) that I used to help with my analysis, understanding, coding and debugging
4) The the test cases (except for £100) mentioned in the spec all run well within 1 second. 
5) To see the code working, simply run all the tests within the file CalculatorTests.cs within CoinMachine.BusinessLogicTests project
